Everything in Python is an object. You can think of them as containers that inhabit these objects along with their names. 
When we execute our program, namespaces are created. 
The name of each object acts as a key and the object itself as a value. 
Every function, module, or library has its own unique namespaces. 
If we import the NumPy library, then upon execution of our program, the Python interpreter will generate NumPy's namespace.

intVariable = 5
floatVariable = 4.5
complexVariable = complex(4, 3)
string1 = "Minahil"
string2 = 'Minahil123'
data = True
data1 = False

print()	It is used to display anything on the console.
len()	It is used to find the length of a string, list, tuple, dictionary, etc.
min()	It is used to find the minimum value out of multiple values.
max()	It is used to find the maximum value out of multiple values.
type()	It tells about the data type of a variable.
isinstance()	It confirms if a variable is of xyz type. For example, if 5 is int? This function returns True if yes.

string = "Minahil"
Flowers_List = ["Tulip", "Jasmine", "Rose", "Lili", "Daisy"]
Number_Tuple = ("one", "two", "three")
General_Dictionary = {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2",
    "key5": "value3",
    "key4": "value4",
}

print("The minimum value of string is", min(string)) //M based on order ord('M') = 77 and ord('a') = 97
print("The minimum value of list is", min(Flowers_List)) //Daisy
print("The minimum value of tuple is", min(Number_Tuple)) // one
print("The max value of dictionary is", max(General_Dictionary)) //key5

print(isinstance(2+3j, complex))
x = complex(2,3)
print(x) // 2+3j, it is always j and no other letter.
